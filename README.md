# Drowsiness-Detection
We've developed a Drowsiness Detection System (DDS) using cutting-edge technology, including OpenCV and Keras machine learning models. Our DDS combines computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms to detect driver drowsiness. It uses OpenCV for real-time video analysis, monitoring eye closure, blink rate, and head position. The core of our system relies on Keras deep learning models trained on diverse driver behavior data, allowing it to adapt to various conditions and environments. When drowsiness signs are detected, the DDS alerts the driver with both audible and visual warnings.
